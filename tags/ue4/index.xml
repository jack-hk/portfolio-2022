        <description>Week 9 It&amp;rsquo;s been six weeks since the last chem_lab post and a lot has happened; time for an update!
The block-out has been completed and progress is underway for the model and lighting implementation. The flow of the map has been tested to a good standard and will be revisited regularly throughout the model implementation (to make sure there are no cheaty little peepholes!).
Models Due to the project&amp;rsquo;s focus being level design, not every asset has been created by me, although most have been edited and tailored to fit the desired style of the map.</description>

        <description>Welcome to my brand new site. I will be posting updates on projects I&amp;rsquo;m undergoing like this, so stay tuned! Introduction Unreal Engine; complicated but a gold mine of potential. At the time of writing, I&amp;rsquo;m a UE rookie. My experience in other engines, Unity mostly, chopped down the steep learning curve but the unique approach UE4 takes on some matters took a bit longer to learn.
So that’s what lead me to this project, my second map, chem_lab.</description>
