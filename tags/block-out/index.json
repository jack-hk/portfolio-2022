[{"content":"\nWeek 9 It\u0026rsquo;s been six weeks since the last chem_lab post and a lot has happened; time for an update!\nThe block-out has been completed and progress is underway for the model and lighting implementation. The flow of the map has been tested to a good standard and will be revisited regularly throughout the model implementation (to make sure there are no cheaty little peepholes!).\nModels Due to the project\u0026rsquo;s focus being level design, not every asset has been created by me, although most have been edited and tailored to fit the desired style of the map. Nearly every material has been tinkered with in the node editor and some models were custom-made for more specific uses. Links to the assets packs used can be found here.\nLighting I find lighting implementation to be one of the extremely tough parts of level/environment design. The lighting is what conveys the expression of the map and is a major aspect of narrative design. So getting it right is important to achieve the desired impression on the players.\nDue to how narrative design works, just a simple light can affect how busy an area of the map is. In this case, chem_lab focuses on larger parts of the map to complement the fast-paced, arcade action where players need lots of space to dodge projectiles.\nConclusion The project was successful and produced a ready-to-play PvP map while also improving my experience in UE4 and level design concepts. Some areas could do with improving before being shipped into a game, notably performance (the typical culling song and dance) but it\u0026rsquo;s in a state where it could be played by a full lobby without too many issues.\nResult Click to enlarge ","description":"Styling and finishing off chem_lab, a UE4 multiplayer map.","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["UE4","Level Design","University"],"title":"Finishing chem_lab","uri":"http://jackhk.com/posts/chem_lab-week9/"},{"content":"Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Jack. I\u0026rsquo;ve been messing around with making games since 2014 and now I\u0026rsquo;m in university studying games development. I lean towards the programming aspects but I try to learn the whole bundle because at the end of the day, most of my projects are solo ones and require me to do the art, design, audio and whatever else.\nGames are not the only form of development that interests me; I have studied and briefly worked with web development and software which in the long run has helped me with games.\nFeel free to browse some of my recent projects on itch.io or in the gallery.\n","description":"About me","id":2,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"http://jackhk.com/about/"},{"content":"\nTeam: Me \u0026 Robert Time Limit: 7 Days Icosphere by jack-hk, RobertCL SoundJam 2021 A fun little jam hosted by an indie developer on itch.io. It lasted seven days and the rules were to use only the sounds provided. I did the project with my friend Robert, my role mostly focusing on the art aspects of the game.\nI made all the assets apart form the skybox; which can be found in the credits of the icth.io page if you wanted to pick it up. I know it isn\u0026rsquo;t the most good looking enviroment but it always makes me happier to fully create every asset, it gives it another level of ownership.\nModels Models were made with Blender, Substance Painter and Photoshop.\n","description":"An alien wave survival made in 7 days for SoundJam 2021!","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["Unity","Game Jam","Level Design","Blender","Substance"],"title":"SoundJam: Icosphere","uri":"http://jackhk.com/posts/gamejam-icosphere/"},{"content":" Welcome to my brand new site. I will be posting updates on projects I\u0026rsquo;m undergoing like this, so stay tuned! Introduction Unreal Engine; complicated but a gold mine of potential. At the time of writing, I\u0026rsquo;m a UE rookie. My experience in other engines, Unity mostly, chopped down the steep learning curve but the unique approach UE4 takes on some matters took a bit longer to learn.\nSo that’s what lead me to this project, my second map, chem_lab. To improve my skills in both the UE4 editor and level design while making a cool map; what’s not to love!\nWeek 3 What is chem_lab? First of all; this is a university project. I\u0026rsquo;ve been planning chem_lab for three weeks now and recently started the block-out stage. The map idea is centred around fast-paced, arcade TPS (Third Person Shooter) action; inspired heavily by Team Fortress 2, Quake and Unreal Tournament. Games such as Rogue Company, also made in UE4, influenced the idea of genre-mixing classic arcade aspects with TPS.\nAs the name suggests, it\u0026rsquo;ll be based inside a sci-fi chemical laboratory, with its main feature being the acid surrounding the map (yes, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to jump into it and die). The map can support both 6v6 and 10v10 lobbies with KOTH (King of The Hill) and 5PC (5 Point Capture) game modes, similar to TF2’s control points.\nBlock-Out Blocking-out (BSP brushing in the context of UE4) is ideally the first stage of level implementation where defining the layout is the priority. Details are typically worked on much later down the pipeline; blocking out comprises of basic geometry and in UE4\u0026rsquo;s case BSPs using \u0026lsquo;Geometry Editing\u0026rsquo; mode.\n","description":"Creating a multiplayer 6v6 map in UE4.","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["UE4","Block-Out","Level Design","University"],"title":"Welcome to chem_lab!","uri":"http://jackhk.com/posts/chem_lab-week3/"}]
